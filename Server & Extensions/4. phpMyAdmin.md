# Install and Configure phpMyAdmin

```
sudo apt install phpmyadmin
```

During the installation when the purple screen comes up, leave everything unchecked and choose Ok. Once the install is complete, run the following command:

```
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Follow through the prompts.

After install, run the following commands

```
sudo mysql
MariaDB }> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
```

To access the phpMyAdmin interface, you'll have to create a new server block in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled called phpmyadmin.conf and have this as the contents:

```
server {
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
  server_name 0.0.0.0;
  root /usr/share/phpmyadmin;
  index index.php index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

  access_log /var/log/nginx/phpmyadmin_access.log;
  error_log /var/log/nginx/phpmyadmin_error.log;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php;
  }

  location ~ ^/(doc|sql|setup)/ {
    deny all;
  }

  location ~ \.php$ {
    fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    include fastcgi_params;
    # include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
  }

  location ~ /\.ht {
    deny all;
  }
}
```

Then the final step is to browse to set the permissions of the phpmyadmin folder with the following command

```
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /usr/share/phpmyadmin
```

Now restart nginx with this command

```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

And now you should be able to browse to yourip/phpmyadmin.
